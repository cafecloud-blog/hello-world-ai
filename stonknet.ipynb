    "## Approach summary\n",
    "1. Create a data set that is deemed suitable for performing supervised machine learning on equity prices.\n",
    "2. Create data visualisation tools for some of the training example.\n",
    "3. Use the data visualization tool to print out some of the training example.\n",
